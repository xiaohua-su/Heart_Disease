It is the leading cause of death regardless of gender and for most race/ethnicity. This disease can lead to early death in individuals, increase medicial visits and a lost of productivity in our economy. As such, it is important to try to address this.\n"

    "With how prevalent heart disease is in the nation, it is important for doctors to discuss with their patients about early prevention. In order to do this, doctors would need to know more about a patient’s history in order to diagnose them with having heart disease, potentially requiring blood work in addition. Getting the results from the blood work usually happens after the patient’s is already out of the doctor’s office. Calls will then be made to discuss these results and potential follow up appointments will be made. \n",

    "Our model aims to predict whether a patient, who comes into a doctor’s office/hospital, has heart disease. By being able to predict if the patient has heart disease or not, we can then flag this patient for the doctor electronically. Instead of having to waiting for a phone call for a discussion on, that may not be between the patient and doctor, conversation between the doctor and patient about managing heart disease can begin. This flagging can help start the conversation between the doctor and patient about early prevention steps that can be made and can help lead the doctor in asking certain questions for further verification and testing."

The data contains information of the individual such as `race` and `gender` that we will not use to avoid these biases in our models. A new column was created as the data does not specifically have a column called heart disease but instead has two two columns called `cvdinfr4` and `cvdcrhd4` that corresponded with whether the individual was ever told/diagnose with having a heart attack and told that they had coronary heart disease. Both questions, get at the issue of heart disease."
